# Final_Project

# Where2?

A app built to help find places to eat or meet up with friends for drinks. Pulls from the Yelp api according to your city.

The best way to decide where to eat. Trying to decide where to meet up with friends, or just looking for a great spot to eat? Let us take the work out of deciding. Here at Where2?, we make the decision on "where should we eat?" for you -- because life is hard, eating shouldn't be.

Created as the final group project for the Denver University Coding Bootcamp.
