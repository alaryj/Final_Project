# Where2?

Trying to decide where to meet up with friends, or just looking for a great spot to eat? Let us take the work out of deciding. Here at Where2?, we make the decision on "where should we eat?" for you -- because life is hard, eating shouldn't be.

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
